# Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal. This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.

A detailed description of the dataset can be found on the city of Chicago's website, but to summarize, the database has the following tables:

- census_data
- schools
- crimes

1. We download the data from the Chicago Data Portal.
2. Build the SQL tables
3. Analyse and query the data with Python
